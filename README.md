# Ion-Lang
The Ion Programming Language
Simple and Powerful

### Goals of Ion
Ion aims to be a granular language for those who need it. It will have functions like `prc <path>` to execute a file. For other programmers it aims to be a simple language.

### Platforms

Ion is officially supported on Linux. However using WSL if your on Windows or a VM will probably work just fine. If you have issues and are on Windows or MacOS please still report them.

### How is it made?

Ion is written in C#. To build Ion for yourself just run the `build.sh` file.
