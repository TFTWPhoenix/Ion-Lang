# Ion-Lang

### The way of the dodo.

Ion-Lang has gone the way of the dodo for a few reasons:

#1. Its in C# I don't know what I was thinking there...
#2. I can't get .NET to install at the moment. (I'm aware I can use mono)

It has sucessors don't worry!

Corvus is a planned successor to Ion.

The Ion Programming Language.

Simple and Powerful!

### Goals of Ion
Ion aims to be a granular language for those who need it. It will have functions like `prc <path>` to start a process. But it will also have "comfort features." And features for people who prefer letting the language handle things.

### Platforms

Ion is officially supported on Linux. However using WSL if your on Windows or a VM will probably work just fine. If you have issues and are on Windows or MacOS please still report them.

### How is it made?

Ion is written in C#. To build Ion for yourself just run the `build.sh` file.
