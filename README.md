# Ion-Lang
The Ion Programming Language

### Goals of Ion
Ion aims to be a granular language for those who need it. It doesnt need to be granular however. In the future there will be keywords like `auto` for variables and `detectType` to detect what type a given piece of data is. It will have functions like `shell()` to run a command via the users default shell.

### Platforms

Ion is officially supported on Linux. However using WSL if your on Windows or a VM will probably work just fine. If you have issues and are on Windows or MacOS please still report them.
